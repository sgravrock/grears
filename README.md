# grears
A bicycle gear calculator

## Getting started

First, install [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) if you don't already have it. Then
you can either start a development environment by running `elm-reactor` or
generate a standalone build by running `elm-make main.elm --output grears.html`.

There are a few unit tests. To run them, install elm-test by running
`npm install -g elm-test` and then run `elm test`.
